ðŸ“˜ Project Reflection: IP Tracker Web App
During the development of the IP Tracker project, I aimed to build a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that could fetch and display IP-related information from a public API. The goal was to create a user-friendly tool that shows the geolocation, ISP, and other relevant details of an entered IP address, as well as the userâ€™s own IP when no input is provided.

One of the initial challenges was selecting a reliable and free IP geolocation API. After testing a few, I opted for a service like ip-api.com due to its simplicity and lack of authentication requirements. Another difficulty involved handling asynchronous requests in JavaScript. Understanding how to properly use fetch() and work with JSON responses was essential to ensuring the app behaved reliably under different conditions (e.g., invalid IP input or no internet).

Styling the application with responsive CSS was another learning experience. I focused on keeping the design clean and readable on both desktop and mobile devices. Debugging layout issues across screen sizes required some trial and error with Flexbox and media queries.

If I were to improve the project, I would integrate a map display using Leaflet.js to visually show the IP's location. Iâ€™d also enhance error handling for API failures and include more detailed user feedback. Additionally, deploying the project on GitHub Pages or Netlify would make it easily accessible for users online.

Overall, the project helped solidify my understanding of front-end development and working with external APIs.
